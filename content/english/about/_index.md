I'm a tech enthusiast, developer, and problem solver with a passion for servers, networking, and building impactful solutions. Currently pursuing my studies at Manipal Institute of Technology, I love experimenting with technology, creating innovative projects, and constantly learning. 

From deploying cloud servers to optimizing backend systems, I enjoy solving complex challenges and sharing my knowledge through projects and collaborations. Beyond tech, I have a strong interest in finance, basketball, history, and geopolitics.

Let's connect and build something amazing! ðŸš€
